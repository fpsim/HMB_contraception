# Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Add-On
This repository contains code to add in heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) dynamics to FPsim. 

This includes:
- Adding a heavy menstrual bleeding state for agents and parameterizing with data
- Adding an iron-deficient anemia state for agents, and providing an odds ratio to link HMB to anemia
- Allowing HMB to probabilistically disrupt schooling for girls
